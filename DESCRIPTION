Description: Implements functions that calculate upper prediction 
  bounds on the false discovery proportion (FDP) in the list of discoveries 
  returned by competition-based setups, implementing Ebadi et al. (2022)
  <arXiv:2302.11837>. Such setups include target-decoy competition (TDC) 
  in computational mass spectrometry and the knockoff construction in linear 
  regression (note this package typically uses the terminology of TDC). Included 
  is the standardized (TDC-SB) and uniform (TDC-UB) bound on TDC's FDP, and the 
  simultaneous standardized and uniform bands. Requires 
  pre-computed Monte Carlo statistics available at 
  <https://github.com/uni-Arya/fdpbandsdata>. This data can be downloaded by
  running the command 'devtools::install_github("uni-Arya/fdpbandsdata")' in R
  and restarting R after installation. The size of this data is roughly 81Mb.
