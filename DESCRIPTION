Description: This package contains functions that calculate upper prediction 
  bands on the false discovery proportion (FDP) in the list of discoveries 
  returned by competition-based setups, implementing [insert paper link here]. 
  Such setups include target-decoy competition (TDC) in computational mass 
  spectrometry and the knockoff construction in linear regression. Included is 
  the standardized band (TDC-SB), uniform band (TDC-UB) and the band of 
  Katsevich-Ramdas (2018) <arXiv:1803.06790> (TDC-KR).
